# Starbucks-Capstone

### This repository contains the code and data used to perform an analysis of the Starbucks offer completion rates using machine learning methods. The goal of this project is to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, and to identify factors that affect the completion of promotional offers.

## Libraries Used
The analysis was performed using the following Python libraries:
Pandas: for data manipulation and preprocessing
NumPy: for numerical operations and calculations
Matplotlib: for data visualization and plotting
Seaborn: for advanced data visualization and plotting
Scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms and models

## Motivation
The motivation of this project is to help businesses, like Starbucks, to optimize their promotional strategies and increase customer engagement. By analyzing customer behavior and preferences, we can identify which offers are more likely to be completed, who are the customers that are more likely to complete them, and what are the factors that affect their completion. This information can be used to design more effective and personalized marketing campaigns, and to improve the overall customer experience.

## Files in the Repository
This repository contains the following files:
Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook that contains the code used to perform the analysis, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation
README.md: this file, which provides information about the project and its contents
Summary of Results

## The analysis of the Starbucks data set using machine learning methods resulted in the following key findings:
1. people in their 60s and close to 100 years old, and we can deduce from the plot that as people age, their chance of accepting an offer will also increase.
2. women pay more money than men do may suggest that women are more responsive to offers.
3. Ages 45 to 75 would like the offer to come by email, but it practically doesn't matter what form of contact it is
4. Discount offer for coffee is more appealing to customers
5. BOGO and our preferred "Discount" offer were the two that were most frequently presented
6. The differences in accuracy between the models are relatively small, with logistic regression and Bayesian classifier slightly outperforming KNN
